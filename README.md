# Case Problem
Using savant play-by-play data, identify characteristics of pitchers who have success in their specific roles. This could be a "starter", "reliever", "swingman" or even something else. Based on these archetypes, determine multiple pitchers who may benefit from a role change. Finally, explain why these roles may be better for them. 

# Our Appraoch
Focusing on the relief pitcher roles, we decided to cluster the players based on their tendencies. First, we clustered based on how they faired with batted balls as well as how pitchers approach plate discipline. Next, we clustered based on how pitcher's were used out of the bullpen and in which situations they were brought into the game. After clustering, we analyzed what showed a pitcher's success or what roles certain pitchers may succeed more in.
